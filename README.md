- Docker

## Features

## Process

This was my first Web Development Project. I decided to hard code everything so I can learn how to manually do certain interactions. I had lots of fun learning the structure and how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all played together.

I also had to utilize a lot of open resources but that also lead me to finding the AOS and SweetAlert Libraries. I believe adding those two libraries helped improve the design of my website.After completing the bones and styling of the project, I also had to do a lot of trial and error when making my website fully responsive.

After a few months, I then decided to add some backend technologies to the website. I learned some basic PHP and used PHPMailer to handle my contact form submissions with the Gmail SMTP Server. I then used Docker to create my containers before deploying on Render. Overall, I had such a fun time learning the basics of Web Development.
